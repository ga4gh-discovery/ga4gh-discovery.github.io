SchemaBlocks is a “cross-workstreams, cross-drivers” initiative to document GA4GH object standards and prototypes, as well as common data formats and semantics. Schemablocks does not represent a typical  "Discovery product", since participants from different work streams and driver projects provide contributions which are then aligned to reflect "best of" GA4GH recommendations and implementation blue prints.

The GA4GH __SchemaBlocks__ site can be accessed though the permanent link [schemablocks.org](http://schemablocks.org), with the code repositories residing on Github in the [ga4gh-schemablocks](https://github.com/ga4gh-schemablocks/) organisation.
