The Search group meets every other Wednesday (11am ET) on a joint conference call with the Networks group. Meeting minutes are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p3xcXZeibYEf08i7XgjwSm8J5nNBF0PsMIvs3gWpKlU/edit) ([archive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sG--PPVlVWb1-_ZN7cHta79uU9tU2y-17U11PYzvMu8/edit#)).

The group works on a [standard for searching of biomedical data](https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-discovery-search) with support for federation across organizational boundaries.
