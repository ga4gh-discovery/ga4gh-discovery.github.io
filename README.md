## GA4GH Discovery Work Stream

Welcome to the homepage for the GA4GH Discovery Work Stream. We build standards for federated, secured networks of data and services, forming an “Internet of Genomics”, and asking meaningful questions across it.

The Discovery Work Stream is lead by Harindra Arachchi and Marc Fiume. For details on how this Work Stream operates please read the [Discovery Work Stream Organizational Structure & Vision document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WFjZ9yBx8Vxn97QORRNQN7O3DBnhpwEUX2mK7f2C4EA/edit?ts=59ed3535#).
