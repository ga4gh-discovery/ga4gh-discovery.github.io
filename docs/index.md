# GA4GH Discovery Work Stream

The [GA4GH Discovery Work Stream](https://ga4gh-discovery.github.io) builds and coordinates standards for federated, secured networks of data and services, to form an “Internet of Genomics” for enabling data discovery and retrieval in health research and clinical genomics.

The Discovery Work Stream is lead by Marc Fiume and Michael Baudis. For details on how this Work Stream operates please read the [Discovery Work Stream Organizational Structure & Vision document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WFjZ9yBx8Vxn97QORRNQN7O3DBnhpwEUX2mK7f2C4EA/edit?ts=59ed3535#).

This group meets at a high-level monthly. In addition, the sub-groups listed below meet on their own schedules. Participation in these groups is open but requires adherence to the [GA4GH Standards for Professional Conduct](https://www.ga4gh.org/docs/GA4GH-Standards-for-Professional-Conduct_22-Jan-2018.pdf).

!!! note "Transitional Status of Website & Work Stream Structure"

    Following the 2023 April GA4GH Connect meeting we're currently in a phase of
    workstream "refactoring", incuding this site.

    Please be patient and check back frequently!

## Products

Product development in GA4GH follows a process outlined in a [GA4GH Product Approval Process Guide, in draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUJSnsPw32W5r1jaJ0vI11X0LLLygpAC9TNosjSge_w/edit#heading=h.tyqycskyykwh). Products developed by the work stream undergo an initial investigation phase, followed by a formal Proposed Product Phase, in which most of the work is done, followed by an formal Approval Phase during which the products gain GA4GH Approval. The formal steps require the approval of the Work Stream leads.

The following products are currently under development for this Work Stream. 

### Beacon API

The Beacon protocol defines the protocol details for implementing programming
interfaces ("API") on genomic data resources, to enable the federated discovery and
potential retrieval of genomic variations and associated biomedical information. 
The current version 2 ("v2") of the Beacon protocol is a [__GA4GH approved standard__](https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/). It is being developed through the [ELIXIR Beacon project](https://beacon-project.io) and accessible there or directly trough its [repository](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2/). Extensive documentation of the protocol and 
its implementation options is available at [docs.genomebeacons.org](https://docs.genomebeacons.org).

### Networks

Networks group works on a collection of standards enabling discovery of services. This currently includes 2 [__GA4GH approved standards__](https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/):

- [Service Registry](https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-registry) - API specification for services providing information about other GA4GH services, primarily for the purpose of organizing services into networks or groups and service discovery across organizational boundaries.
- [Service Info](https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-info) - API specification for services to advertise information about themselves.

### {S}[B] SchemaBlocks

SchemaBlocks represents a __cross work stream, cross driver project__ initiative to document object standards and prototypes with potenial use throughout the GA4GH ecosystem. This
project does not attempt to develop a rigid, complete schema but rather to provide the object vocabulary and semantics for a large range of developments.

More information about the _SchemaBlocks_ project as well as the current schema can be found on the project's site at [schemablocks.org](https://schemablocks.org).

Before 2023 the [{S}[B]]((https://schemablocks.org)) site did also contain
documentation about common GA4GH standards and practices related to genomics. This
part has now been moved to the [ga4gh-community-standards](http://ga4gh-community-standards.github.io)
site.
